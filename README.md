## Course Information

### Calendar Description
Students build upon knowledge of regression in further applications, particularly in experimental design. Students learn how to create different kinds of samples with various properties, and how to analyze such samples after the data has been collected. Students learn how to frame these designs in a regression framework to build upon existing knowledge in new situations such as models involving blocking, factors, and hierarchies. Students learn how to perform the corresponding niche inferences such (multiple) analysis of (co)variance.

### Educational Objectives
Upon completion of the course the students will be expected to:
1. Select and create the appropriate experimental designs tailored for particular analyses.
2. Analyze data from various designs.
3. Recognize designs that are not necessarily regression and realize how regression approaches apply to them.


### Course Topics
1. Design definitions
2. Completely randomized designs
  - One factor
  - Factorial designs
3. Randomized block designs
  - Randomized complete block designs
  - Latin square designs
4. Designs to study variance
  - One-factor sampling experiments
  - Multiple-factor sampling experiments
  - Nested and Staggered sampling experiments
  - Designs with fixed and random factors
5. Incomplete and confounded block designs
